Stuff that needs to be done to run this case

-- COMPILE --
make TPL -j
make -j

-- Generate Turbulence initial condition --
python gen_hit_ic.py -k0 4 -N 128

-- Run --
srun -n 36 PeleLMeX2d.gnu.TPROF.MPI.ex input.nn


#### NOTES ####
Contained are files to run with an FGM+ANN model trained on a 1D premixed flame
and a CMLM model trained from corresponding 3D DNS

Required files include a pmf data file used to set the initial condition.
In the input.nn file, set either

   pmf.datafile =  "prem_posf10325_phi1_p1_t298_mani_cmlm.dat"
-- OR --
   pmf.datafile =  "prem_posf10325_phi1_p1_t298_mani_fgm.dat"

Also required are a neural network file and info file.
In the input.nn file, set either

   manifold.filename = cmlm_net.pnn
   manifold.info_filename = cmlm_net_info.txt
-- OR --
   manifold.filename = fgm_net.pnn
   manifold.info_filename = fgm_net_info.txt

Note that the CMLM model is a 2D manifold while the FGM one is a 1D manifold.
This means the correct setting must be used in the GNUmakefile when compiling:

   Chemistry_Model = Manifold2d
-- OR --
   Chemistry_Model = Manifold
